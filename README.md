## Components

### 1. Neural Perception Module

- Vision-Language Model (VLM) based on CLIP/LLaVA
- Extracts embeddings from images and text
- Provides high-dimensional tensor representations

### 2. Symbolic Reasoning Module

- Rule-based inference engine using first-order logic
- Ontology-based decision making
- Knowledge graph for structured reasoning

### 3. Triton-Optimized Kernels

- Efficient matrix operations
- Boolean logic operations
- Optimized neural-symbolic fusion

### 4. Fusion Module

- Combines neural embeddings with symbolic logic
- Makes final decisions based on both systems
- Provides explainable AI outputs

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the test script:
   ```
   python test.py
   ```

## Example Usage

```python
from neuro_symbolic import NeuroSymbolicSystem

# Initialize the system
system = NeuroSymbolicSystem()

# Process an image and text
result = system.process(
    image_path="data/cat.jpg",
    text="A cute animal"
)

# Print the results
print(result)
```

## Performance

The Triton-optimized kernels provide significant speedups compared to naive PyTorch implementations, especially for the fusion operations between neural and symbolic systems.

## Extending the System

New symbolic rules can be added to `symbolic_reasoning/rules.py` to extend the system's reasoning capabilities.
